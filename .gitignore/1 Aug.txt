What is the need of DBMS?
Database systems are basically developed for large amount of data. When dealing with huge amount of data,
 there are two things that require optimization: Storage of data and retrieval of data.

Storage: According to the principles of database systems, the data is stored in such a way that it acquires
 lot less space as the redundant data (duplicate data) has been removed before storage. Let’s take a layman 
 example to understand this:
In a banking system, suppose a customer is having two accounts, one is saving account and another is salary
 account. Let’s say bank stores saving account data at one place (these places are called tables we will
 learn them later) and salary account data at another place, in that case if the customer information such
 as customer name, address etc. are stored at both places then this is just a wastage of storage 
 (redundancy/ duplication of data), to organize the data in a better way the information should be stored 
 at one place and both the accounts should be linked to that information somehow. The same thing we achieve
 in DBMS.

Fast Retrieval of data: Along with storing the data in an optimized and systematic manner, it is also 
important that we retrieve the data quickly when needed. Database systems ensure that the data is retrieved
 as quickly as possible.
